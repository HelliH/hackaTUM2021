# hackaTUM2021
**SOB: Save Our Beer!** team project for [ZEISS company](https://www.zeiss.com/) developed and presented during [HackaTUM 2021](https://hack.tum.de/). We took second place in the challenge! 

## Inspiration:
Microscopes are used in the brewery process to detect the exact phase of barley seeds to achieve the best taste of your beer.
However, the device is unstable to temperature changes. It causes focus issues that affect photos quality and lead to phase recognition errors. Missed phase or too early false detection can ruin the final beer quality.

Save our beers! 

## Content of the repo:

- **Data exploration with anomaly detection, missing values handler, and forecasting models.ipynb** - in this file we present small part of data understanding anf the main part of ML models for anomaly detection, missing values handler, and forecasting models.
- **SOB_project_presentation.pdf** - slides presented during our 3-minutes hackathon pitch.
- **data_visualization.py** - Python script for data exploration & visualization.
